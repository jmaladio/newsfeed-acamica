## Usage

The webapp was developed using React 16 and the Create React App aka CRA boilerplate. Redux manages the global states with Redux Thunk as the middleware, Styled Components is used to style the UI components. No hooks allowed in this challenge.

If you want to deploy a fullstack webapp with your own backend and db, just change the API endpoints and check the actions file.
